# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
  
  
GAN consist of 2 networks. \
A **Generator** and a **Discriminator.** \
**Generator** generates new images from the images fed and make fake samples. **Discriminator** finds the fake and real samples. With the loss function, we can update both discriminator and generator network until we get a good result.
